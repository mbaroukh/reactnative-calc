# reactnative-calc

This is my first attempt with ReactNative.
A really simple old-school calculator.

I'm not a "fullstack js" programmer.
Comming from Java world, it's hard to integrate new-age's javascript world.
Most of the time the hard part is about buggy tools, incompatible or deprecated libraries, multiples js specifications, ...
Needing a running nodejs to transpile javascript to javascript is not intuitive.

## This is not a real project

I's just a project to learn the basics of RN and Redux.
There is no custom native component.
I used only what's already available.

The project worked at least once on iOS but I did not test after each update on this plateform
so I can't tell for sure that it actually works.
